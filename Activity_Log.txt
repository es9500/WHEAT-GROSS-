Alex: Well, I made some progress on the Unity tutorial, and then got set back. Again. This time it was not only a reset 
of the files, it was some sort of mistake in the code! So now I have to rebuild the file and follow exactly what happened in the video
and hope it works. At least assistance was offered, and I hope I won't have to make use of it, but at least I have a fallback if need
be. I'm not sure learning 3rd dimensional right off the bat was a good call, but I've made my choice, and I'll stick with it. I 
actually wonder if Xander and Evan can see this.

Alright, after due consideration, I've decided to work with 2D Unity for a few reasons. 1) Coding a 2D game sounds like less of a pain and probably is.
2) Going 3D without using a microgame template is jarring and a rather painful experience, and I'd prefer to get something working ASAP. And 3) I made a joke about a game idea
that I'm now legitimately considering. At any rate, I gotta tell the group before anything even begins, and something tells me that I won't be able to reach them Wednesdays.
So unfortunately, nothing will get done today. There are installs I need to work and they aren't here. Gotta remember to bring this in.

Well, today is the day. We start a new game. Only because Unity 3D hates my guts and I hate it with every digit of my body. Evan
wants to recreate a game called "Shrek-Kart". I'm a little hesitant, but a project is a project and at this rate the less we have
to think about the better. Even though we'll continue into next year, at least we'll have something to improve on. Honestly, I
think I was in over my head starting the first one. Perhaps instead of watching and following tutorials, I just wing it and see
what happens. Like a calculator, but with C# and a bunch of projectiles.

I found scripting tutorials for C#. Future me will be grateful for this while past me looks up from the mess and muck in anger
and disgust, cursing present me's name. So I'll be working on these tutorials for quite some time. Not entirely sure how long,
but it'll be long enough to figure out how to actually make something move and make that movement controllable. I'm not sure what
Evan and Xander have been up to, but I can always ask them. I hope they have some form of an activity log they keep somewhere, or use
this one. Y'know, looking at past entries, I can see why past me hates present me right now...

Monday, March 22, 2021
Today I continue watching the C# tutorials, I'm grateful for recent past me for discovering these sacred files, dawning the Era of Corn. Soon all the code shall be blessed in
cob. Jokes aside, I shall continue my crusade and hopefully learn enough C# to start on some project. I'm gonna let the group know my plan with the Godhunters project.

Tuesday, March 23, 2021
Same stuff as yesterday, learn C#, make something, and go from there. I think my main problem will be implementing assets into projects, so I'll look for tutorials on that.
No clue what everyone else is doing, but I'm at least 87% sure we're being productive... Maybe. Oh Magic Legends will be going open beta today! Can't wait! Change of plans!
We're making an Oompa Loompa shooter! Oh boy, this'll be just enjoyable. I hope we make it out alive, because by-golly am I losing patience!

Well, I'm beginning the change in workflow as far as computers go. I'm gonna spend some of today installing and setting up the workspace for the laptop I take home with me
so I can do work on Wednesdays and stop skipping days in this log. I have only seen Xander use this once, so I'll try and talk with Evan today to see if he can access and see
any of this. I hope so, seeing as how Baker won't be looking near us on the distanced days. And then after that I'll just be doing project stuff, working with meshes, dragging stuff,
and losing my mind as to why a sniper model won't work! Fun stuff today.

Friday, March 26, 2021
So, I got some actual progress made (scary, I know) and I forgot to talk with Evan and Xander about this log. And I think I can care less at this point. I really only think Xander used
it once to prove he could access it and I have no clue about Evan. But, I at least know he is doing something. Xander I'm clueless about. Since we only see him the first 2 days of the
week and has put an emphasis on not wanting to do the work through repetitious demands of being a "researcher", I think he is looking up models and designs that either Evan or I will
have to edit and work with. Not that I personally have a problem, but this is a bit of a workflow problem. Typical group project fashion, just a bit disguised. From here on out I'll be
instilling the "want it you make it" rule. Maybe that will help him score some participation, or keep him occupied. At any rate, today is gonna be typical work day, work on a boss level,
tinker with some models, maybe start making level transfers.

Monday, March 29, 2021
Today is gonna be a typical work day, not entirely sure what that means, since the last entry was pretty much a lie. Toying with 3D models and such was and will still be a nightmare, 
but at least I know of a YouTube channel that can help teach a few things. It'll still hurt though. I think today I'll just put an emphasis on level design, I don't want to overthink
anything and have something blue screen or explode.

Tuesday, March 30, 2021
Well, we started a new project yet again. This time there is borderline nothing. A somewhat clean slate for the project. I'm not sure what Xander is doing if anything, but Evan
and I are gonna be working on making some levels, or maybe just make an FPS bullet-hell or something, I don't know yet. Today I'll be working on a resume for the sake of grade and
then I'll browse YouTube for some fundamental level designs.

Wednesday, March 31, 2021
Ok, so this and the attendance quiz are the only things I'll be working for Talent Center. 

Thursday, April 1, 2021
Prankster Day has arrived! Not that it means much... Just means I'll have to combat the stupidity of select family. Anyway I'm not gonna do anything programming related since I have
assignments from other classes to work on. Don't rightly know what Evan is doing, so I'll ask him if he is capable of accessing this. Hopefully he is, or has his own brand of this.


Evan:
Someone's Log, Star-Date, 113758-230 Alpha, also known as Earth's April Fools Day.
My daily journey began with working on AdvArrayLists2 and finishing it. I then started to wonder if being in the vast emptiness of a room was enough for my life choices.
the strange being behind me is working on some sort hand circuit array attached to his computer, interesting. I must focus on finishing classes and gradebook though. For my
whole team depends on me to focus on the project at hand.

Xander: the confuser
Entry log 3/22/21
So I have no idea what I am doing. The C# stuff is a bit too confusing for me, but im trying my best to manage these issues. 
I don't know if I've chosen the right class or not but I don't want to fail the team. 
I hope Alex makes me do more research than coding, because this crap sharpy suuucks
