Alex: Well, I made some progress on the Unity tutorial, and then got set back. Again. This time it was not only a reset 
of the files, it was some sort of mistake in the code! So now I have to rebuild the file and follow exactly what happened in the video
and hope it works. At least assistance was offered, and I hope I won't have to make use of it, but at least I have a fallback if need
be. I'm not sure learning 3rd dimensional right off the bat was a good call, but I've made my choice, and I'll stick with it. I 
actually wonder if Xander and Evan can see this.





Evan: Today I started watching vidoes on how poeple had prgressed with there works in Unity and Blender. One of my favorites is Dani as he as memes to how he 
programs his games. I have also started watching clips of gameplay from some of the most famous Games of the 21st Century like Portal 1 & 2, Detroit become Human, Batim, Hitman 1, 
2 and 3. I have also started on a basic story in my head for when i want to build up my own game, or  possible pitch to our group for next years' project. I have been working
myself through Blender with simple models and will start to make some for our game.
